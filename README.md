## Snelinstaller - lightweight text-based installer

Snelinstaller (SI) installs quickly, but to create a definition takes some time.  :-)
With SI you can create dirs, copy files, edit files and executes commands. 

It only has been tested on linux. Packages still have to be uploaded, so currently it only is usable for nim-developers, instead of regular users. The software is in beta-phase; not heavily tested in different environments. 

A future-version must have a definition-file that is name-based instead of order-based. Also a windows-version is foreseen. However, it is not a priority-project.
