Manual of Snel_installer - version 2.0

FAQ
Does snel-installer overwrite pre-existing folders and files?



Format of the installation-definition-file (def-file):
it contains multiple blocks with specific tasks.
A separator-string divides the blocks.
Each block-header is a specific string written in
capital letters. This header-string determines the 
handling of the block.

The lines after the block-header contain the actual 
install-data. The order of line-numbers is relevant to
how they are handled by the installer.
(a future-version may be name-based instead of 
order-based).

The first line after the header is allways a 
comment-line and should tell what the block does.

The second line is allways an arguments-line in which additional 
arguments can be added with a format:
arguments---arg1=value1,,arg2=value2

Currently supported arguments (second line of each block): 
for block: TARGET-LOCATION AND SOURCE-FILES TO COPY
linux_set_exe=1			enable executable bits for executable files in linux
linux_use_sudo=1		use linux-admin rights (but then call also like: sudo snel_installer)


The block "EDIT FILE (ADD, DELETE, REPLACE LINES)" has three possible
operations: inserting lines, deleting lines and replacing a single line.
The operations are performed on one or more lines that are located by 
the variables target-file, search-direction, occurrence, locating-string and 
line-orientation (before, after or on). The latter indicates the orientation
of the operation relative to the located line.
The insertions-operation can also add empty lines. The 
replacement-operation can only work ON the located line. The line that is 
searched is unique together the occurrence of the 
search-string. For the locating of the search-needy sentence it is 
possible to use a (unique) front-part of the sentence as search-string.
(instead of the entire sentence).
If your search-config is faulty and does not deliver a 
located line, SI will give you an error. (e.g. if you ask for the 4th
occurence of a search-string and there are only two occurrences.)

Below is a description of the definition which explains how 
to fill in the lines and what the installer expects.

The last block is EXECUTE SHELL-COMMANDS.
Any arbitrary linux-command can be executed here.


DIRECTORIES TO CREATE
your-comment-here
arguments---none (default is none, above you see available args)
-list all the directories to be created with full paths,
but home-dir sign (~) is filled in automatically
(all subdirs must be created separately; 
if dirs allready exist the creation is skipped)
>----------------------------------<
TARGET-LOCATION AND SOURCE-FILES TO COPY
your-comment-here
arguments---none
target-location-path
all source-files to be copied to the above target-location
>----------------------------------<
TARGET-LOCATION AND SOURCE-FILES TO COPY
your-comment-here
arguments---none
and so many as neccessary
>----------------------------------<
EDIT FILE (ADD, DELETE, REPLACE LINES)
your-comment-here
arguments---none
operation; pick from: insertions, deletions or replacement
file-path to the file to edit
search-direction: forward or backward
occurence of string (1-based number)
search-string = locating-string (place where to put the commands)
relative position to search-string = line-orientation (before, on, after)
Depending of above chosen operation, do one of the following:
Then for insertions place here multiple text-lines (commands) you want to insert.
For deletions the number of lines you want to delete. (on, after or before)
For replacement the string to-replace, and the to replace-to.
end-of-new-lines-here (fixed string so that installer knows the end)
